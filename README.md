# Chloe and Demeter form the crop management system for our maize research.  Preparing for public release.

   + *chloe*:  a set of Perl scripts to process raw data; generate tags, labels, and barcodes; and miscellaneous crop management tasks.
   + *demeter*: a Prolog database for crop, genetic, and phenotype data; associated data provenance; and code for pedigree generation, crop planning, and management of field work.
   
   Both rely entirely on open-source tools.

See [chloe.org](./docs/chloe/chloe.org) for details.

Note that dates are in the form day.month.year.
