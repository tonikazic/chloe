# Chloe and Demeter are the code components of our crop management system for our maize research.  


   + *chloe*:  a set of Perl scripts to process raw data; generate tags, labels, and barcodes; and miscellaneous crop management tasks.
   + *demeter*: a Prolog database for crop, genetic, and phenotype data; associated data provenance; and code for pedigree generation, crop planning, and management of field work.
   
   Both rely entirely on open-source tools.

See [chloe.org](./docs/chloe/chloe.org) and [a poster](./docs/chloe/poster.pdf) describing this work at the 2019 Maize Genetics Conference for details.

Comments and pull requests are welcome, *especially for the documentation*.  
Please use the Github issue machinery for reporting issues, rather than emailing me.  
I can guide you in adapting the code for your work: you don't need to know much about
writing code to get started.

Note that dates are in the form day.month.year.
