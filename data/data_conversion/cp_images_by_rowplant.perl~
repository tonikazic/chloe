# a script to take a crop, list of rows, and a date, and copy all images to /athe/c/maize/experiments/time_course_13r/images_by_row_num,
# putting each image in its row directory and date subdirectory, and in the
# eheu_dump subdirectory, and renaming the images so that when they are 
# dumped into eheu, they will sort by rowplant.


# for the list of rows, get the subdirectories that have numbers in this directory

# for the image data, use demeter/data/image.pl


# call:  perl ./convert_data CROP DUMPDAY
