next things to do:

1.  construct the regular expression to parse data lines on the fly, using
the column headers to find the correct regular expressions.  This will make
data processing much more robust to re-ordering spreadsheet columns to
accommodate different devices.


2.  further modularize the code: nearly all scripts follow the same general
pattern.  Different types of information require different checks and
processing:  these should be subroutined based on the type of menu.



3.  change regex for the datetime to accommodate incomplete dates and
12 hour time, then convert to correct dates and 24 hour times.
