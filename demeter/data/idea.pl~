idea(2,'Could M14 potentiate expression --- e.g. accelerating kinetics or intensity --- compared to Mo20W and W23?  Compare rows 35 -- 39 (les*-N2013) and rows 112, 113 (spc1-N1376).  It''s almost as if the mutant switches from recessive to dominant in different backgrounds.  Either that or there are many phenocopies or I am bug-eyed.',toni,date(2,7,2009),time(14,30,0)).

idea(7,'Mo20W throwing 2 -- 3 shoots; W23 3 -- 4; M14 3--4.  Some Mo20W plants seem to have only one true shoot.  Often the topmost shoot is really vestigial and never becomes an ear -- a fooler.',toni,date(20,7,2009),time(15,51,0)).


idea(8,'Les5-N1449 is officially necrotic, with small, round, white lesions, but mgdb also shows many small chlorotic lesions. In the mixed W23/M14 background of rows 180 and 181, I saw only white, squarish, chlorotic lesions.  Two genes?  Phenotype different in different background?',toni,date(4,8,2009),time(5,26,0)).


idea(9,'Les4 is necrotic lesions, large, white, irregular, sometimes fusing.',toni,date(4,8,2009),time(5,26,0)).


idea(10,'W silks before M, which silks before S under current conditions.  When a W tassel is shedding, the ear is silking; S silks somewhat before shed; and M silks quite a bit before shed.  S tassels leak pollen slowly, never expanding out the way W and M tassels do.  S strongly prefers warmer weather; W cooler; and M seems indifferent.  The south side of the field is noticeably warmer than the north.  For example, today I found 101 selfable M14 plants in the second planting (those with the center of the spike flowering to an optimal flowering).  On the other hand, I found 56 selfable plants in just the first two south columns.  So S is ready to self, but M is still not.',toni,date(5,8,2009),time(22,0,0)).


idea(11,'The ideal S ear is probably about an inch at the base, while W is 0.75 - 1 inch.  M14 is a long narrow ear, ideal width about 0.75 inch, plus or minus 0.25 inch.',toni,date(5,8,2009),time(22,0,0)).

idea(12,'M14 has many bad tassels this year -- the same range of crummy tassel phenotypes we have seen in some of the lesion mutants.  So think the inbred is the sources of these.  There do seem to be metabolic effects of the various mutants, but given the crappy tassel phenotypes appearing in the inbred it is reasonable to assume M14 is contributing those.',toni,date(5,8,2009),time(22,0,0)).

idea(13,'Les15 in rows 242--259 has light chlorotic spots, but the original in W23 from Marty has big brown necrotics in a little plant (which may not be ready in time to pollinate; and, the germination rate was terrible).  The chlorotics can be scored by eye, but looks like a W23 tester will be needed for sure.',toni,date(5,8,2009),time(22,0,0)).


idea(14,'There are at least two other loci in W23 that influence expression of Les7 that are not in Mo20W or M14.  Our W23/Les7 guys have five levels of expression, including wild type; extremal ones are not seen in the other two lines.  These are segregating.  Don''t know what the other three states of the system are yet, but these may become clearer with more back-crossing and image quantitation.  Have scored rows 190 - 214 but not yet recorded the data.  Am trying to pollinate all different levels from all families into S, W, M, but the extremal guys have small, weak tassels.  Priority is W.  Tried glassine bags but too fussy for me right now.',toni,date(4,8,2009),time(15,0,0)).


idea(15,'Something wrong with most of the Gerau lines:  only D10 and Tp1 have mutants.  Believe I can distinguish the homozygotes from the heterozygotes, though as Clay correctly observes there are several different heights. These are great, though. Hsf1 has only two plants.   Checked all against MaizeGDB.',toni,date(6,8,2009),time(19,0,0)).


idea(16,'Next time just skip our current back range in the long part of the L; too soggy for the plants to grow well.  This is about 30 - 40 feet.  Plant a lot of sweet corn there for the raccoons and maybe they won''t bother the experimental corn.',toni,date(7,8,2009),time(5,0,0)).

idea(17,'W23 tassels before silking, and sheds some, too.  So can wait to shoot bag those until tassels proud, but then have to hurry or the ears are contaminated.  Under current conditions, W23 ears need longer to regrow cut silks than Mo20W or M14.',toni,date(6,8,2009),time(15,0,0)).

idea(18,'Silking and flowering order is W23 >> Mo20W >~ M14.  W23 tassels are canonical:  branches extend, anthers deploy in waves.  Mo20W tassels never extend and dribble anthers out during flowering.  Best indication shedding has begun is that the center of the center spike will have a little flush; this is probably optimum, or a little before optimum, for Mo20W. Anthers all over the tassel may be optimum, or may signal the end of shedding, not sure which.  M14 branches deploy at an angle, and the tassel sheds in several fuzzy waves.  Optimal flowering is when the top half of the tassel is shedding:  by the time shedding reaches the lower branches the pollen seems less.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(19,'TAG THE MUTANTS FIRST!  The tags need to go on as soon as possible for scoring to commence.  The inbreds can be tagged after the first ears appear, which will simplify getting the tags in the ear zone.   Early scoring is crucial to managing pollinations and data collection.  Consider marking scoring before ags go on and then collecting the data once tagged; or using labels as light-weight intermediate tags for mutants.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(20,'Cut down more plants for better visibility and easier monitoring.  It isn''t just light for them, but visual clarity for me.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).

idea(21,'In final data collection, note characteristics of plants by row, either in narratives, paper, or palm; get these into the notes for the family.  Maybe just write on index cards, noting row and family, and then type into database.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).

idea(22,'Since the plan is dynamic, no point in putting it on the plant tags.  The plan tags were somewhat helpful, but best would be printout that fits in the apron pocket on the little clipboard, or a flip book like Gerry''s, which could also have phenotype pictures.  Card stock wouldn''t have to be as heavy, just index cards.  If a flip book, then the (dated) notes of idea 21 could be easily written as the season progresses and transferred into the database as I go along or at the end.  Use of the circa binding rings would let the book be printed on paper, but the largest rings are too small for one page/line.  Key point is it has to fit easily into the big apron pocket and facilitate entry into the database.  In principle, the notes could go directly into the palm by row stake and then transferred to the plan by predicate.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).

idea(23,'Next year, the selfs and back-crosses in the first planting; the introductions and hybrids in the second planting; 2 -- 3 inbred plantings, with the third very small for stragglers.  For this year''s pollinations, plot pollinations vs. growing degree days for the mutants, and also notice which inbred planting they were pollinated into.  W23 is about a week ahead of Mo20W and M14, but this may change next year with the new seed stocks.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(24,'The most important lesson is to walk through the corn EVERY DAY.  I can strategize a bit, but I need to have a complete picture of the field at least every few days.  Cutting back more plants will help with this, but it''s probably best to walk the rows, rather than the ranges.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).

idea(25,'The best way to organize the pollinations seems to be by goal --- backcross, introductions (usually splits), selfs, splits by type; then by intended female; then in rowplant order for males.  This makes the take-down a little more complicated --- I must be confident the list of daddies is current --- but it sure simplifies the pollinations.  This way, I can simply put the tags in order, grouping the different splits together, and go.  If I don''t like an ear I can go on to the next one.  This also helps with remembering to take down the right number of tags.  The printout is organized the same way, with spaces between each type of pollination.  Each stack of tags is labelled with a fluorescent stickie and the type of ears it contains; the stacks, rubber-banded together, travel in the right deep apron pocket; the current stack in the right shallow apron pocket.  The shoot bag rubber bands are used for each stack, wrapped twice so they are not so tight that it is hard to get the tag out.  When selfing ears for inbred seed production, try to keep these in columns so I can move easily among the columns.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(26,'Tag management is the other key to the scheme.  Pull tags for ears when these are cut, as before, but keep them grouped by intended use:  mutant selfs, ears for back- and out-crosses, inbred selfs.  When a tassel needs to be set up, pull that tag --- but be sure to keep the daddy tags separate from the mommy tags!  Then use the daddy tags on the tassel bags.  When a plant is to be selfed, pull both tags when the ear is cut, separating them later.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(27,'Our row stakes are good, but can be better.  Think wire stacks with tight loop on top (to hold seed packet during planting) with slight bend (20 degreees or so) just down from the top to easily read the large fluorescent pink label that is threaded on to the stake and secured by a cable tie.  Height should be at least two feet above ground, maybe three.  Manufacture from pre-cut wire if possible; investigate methods to easily produce consistent bends and a tight loop.  Loop should be large enough to easily rack the stakes for storage, fit on a finger, and push into the soil comfortably.  When we walk into them they will bend, not break.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(28,'Slow manufacture of plant tags is a big problem.  Once can cut them apart with the paper cutter, but that doesn''t increase the speed much.  Printing each row down through the stack would, but then the first tag of each row would need a warning stripe across the top to signal a new stack.  Flexing several tags along the perforation lets one pull them off easily.  Each tag would have to be numbered col-page in case of disorganization.  I have experimented with punching out the large threading hole by bringing a few tags down on the 3/8 inch punch clamped upright in the vise --- works surprisingly well.  A stacker (fixed on adjacent sides, varying on the other two) and template for drilling would be faster.  Might want to dremel out the rest of the slot. Once manufactured, threading them on a length of #9 wire, stopped at either end and separating each row by paper clips, works great.  For storage, the tags are bundled with a rubber band; for tagging, they are carried in a tassel bag in the apron pocket.  Another wire over the opposite shoulder to hold the rack securely is a possibility, but isn''t essential.  Don''t print extra tags, get the stand counts right and check the tags early for missing ones; make a palm menu for this to simplify data collection, using the row stakes.  Modify script so the missing tags at the end of each row can be easily made.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(4,30,0)).


idea(29,'Use a separate clipboard for pollinations:  prior plans, current tag stacks.  Would be good to have a rack of some sort for these so the doggie has room in the back.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,0,0)).


idea(30,'Plant a border row of sweet corn down the length of the field where blocks of popcorn or sweet corn not planted otherwise.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,0,0)).

idea(30,'For the pop and sweet corn, only tag the first plant in each row.  OK, maybe the first five.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,0,0)).

idea(31,'DO NOT OVERPLANT ROWS!  Row 117 was a mixture and in other rows the first planting shaded the subsequent rows.  Instead, keep swing rows at the end of the mutants to accomodate mistakes and replantings when the germination rate is poor.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,0,0)).


idea(32,'When I pack the seed, record the number packed.  Will have to change the packed_packet/6 fact and the menu.  Default is 15 for mutants, 20 for inbreds, but some seed with poor germination rate will have higher numbers packed.  Then take this value and print on the label.  This will also help with the planted** fact rearrangement.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,40,0)).

idea(33,'Print out notes of parents from prior years in the subsequent planting, identifying each note by crop.  Do this during planning the crop, too.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(6,40,0)).

idea(37,'Make sure that when we plant, there is a good separation between half-rows.  There were a couple of cases where it was hard to be certain in which half-row a plant fell.  Six inches after the second stake should be ok:  better to bunch up a little than to be confused.  And NO ZIG-ZAGGING!',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(8,0,0)).

idea(38,'Use the ''other action'' field of the mutant menu to generate to-do lists and print these out daily.  Provide a fact for checking off when things are done.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(9,15,0)).

idea(39,'Figure out a way to check that all lines of one gene are planted together when generating the sequence of lines for planting.  The Les9s were separated in the field by not noticing their separation in the planting sequence.',toni,date(10,8,2009),time(9,15,0)).


idea(40,'Next time, consider planting by objective: back-crosses, out-crosses, introductions, selfs, tests, rather than alphabetically by gene name.  This worked well for the selfs in 09r and would have helped keep the work more compact.  This is essentially the way I am organizing the pollinations when I do them, too.   Might combine back- and out-crosses; then this would be compatible with idea 39.',toni,date(11,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).

idea(41,'It looks like for Mo20W and some of Gerry''s babies, the only reliable indicator and peak shed is the center of the center spike of the tassel.  This gets around the dribbly anther problem.',toni,date(11,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).

idea(42,'I tried bagging the tassels in the morning on 11.8.  This worked really well: the plants were still covered with heavy dew but the tassels had air-dried.  Pollen production was good and the pollen fine.  The only trouble was that alpha got wet --- certainly in the bottom connector, maybe water leaked behind the screen at the bottom --- and for a long time the buttons at the bottom of the touch pad wouldn''t work.  Forcefully blowing out the connector in the evening fixed the problem.  The other wrinkle is that for the current code, one must generate fake cross_prep facts for the tassels to be bagged so that the list of ready daddies can be generated.',toni,date(12,8,2009),time(7,0,0)).


idea(43,'Large font for cross pages is important in the field, but try to minimize the number of pages, grouping like actions together.  Too many pages is confusing.',toni,date(12,8,2009),time(7,0,0)).

idea(44,'DO NOT split an inbred planting across the field.  This year the third planting of inbreds was in two different places, which made it hard to construct splits and produced too much running around.',toni,date(12,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).


idea(45,'Here is the rhythm of the season. 0.  Bullet-proof code.  Modify make_plant_tags.perl to generate row tags in stacks, with the first tag striped at the end; shrink size of cross tag barcodes so readout always prints; shift positions of barcodes on wrap-around part of tag; print extra rowplant into around wrap-around; avoid holes.  Figure out what is going on with demeter wrt pollination management. 1.  Plan experiment consulting with Gerry as needed.  2. Request others'' lines. 3.  Ready row stakes (if some must be manufactured, do this over the winter.  If I switch to metal stakes, start early).  4.  Pack seed.  5.  Work out field arrangment (ask Chris destination and keep to less than 500 physical rows).   6.  Ready planting gear.  7.  Plant.  8.  Do stand counts as soon as seed fully germinated.  9.  Generate tags.  10.  If marking emerging leaves, do now with label tags.  Try marking fifth leaves with red twist tie, then for tenth leaf mark stem just over fifth leaf with sharpie and move tag up to 10.  11.  TAG MUTANTS FIRST.  Otherwise they are invisible for scoring and planning pollinations.  Inbreds can wait until fter first round of shoot-bagging unless developmental data are to be collected.  Be sure to tag inbreds in ear zone; good idea for mutants too unless they are unusually short (tall ear zone ok).  Generate only first tag for inbreds and popcorn; do not generate extra tags.  12.  Score and collect plant data, including photographs.  13.  Pollinate (see idea 46).  14.  Harvest and dry, preparing any needed harvest tags.   15.  Inventory and data analysis wrt to time of pollination, inbred planting polliinated for each mutant, number inbreds unused.   Count failed pollinations and discover cause:  e.g. date vs. inbred planting, line, time of pollination, and growing degree days.',toni,date(13,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).


idea(46,'Here is the rhythm of a pollinating day.  1.  Get there just after dawn.  2.  Shoot bag and cut back until time to pollinate, usually 8:30 unless weather very cool.  Watch tassels to be sure of at least a half hour''s shed.   Goal is to finish by noon.  A reasonable number is between 50 -- 90 per day, depending on the number of selfs, splits, and simple dumps.  3.  Finish any cutting back. 4.  Walk through field to choose tomorrow''s tassels.  5.  Bag in evening after heat abates.  Early morning bags can work, but dew on tassel must dry and some lines shed unexpectedly early.  Cool weather and high humidity is no guarantee they won''t shed.',toni,date(13,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).


idea(47,'Here is pollination planning procedure.  1.  Guess number of ears that will be needed the next day, if possible.  Such information might come from tassel watching, a knowledge of the number of back- and out-crosses and selfs that are expected, and the developmental preferences of the inbreds.  During the peak times, ca. 50 of each seems to be a good number.  Mutants are now tracking their inbred background pretty well, so they will advance or retard relative to each other depending on the weather.   2.  Cut back that number in the morning BEFORE pollinating.  3.  After pollinations, survey tassels to set that evening; eventually the watch list will be helpful here.  4.  Sort tags by type of inbred, putting selfs of inbreds or mutants aside, out of the crossing pool.  Organize tags by row.   Splits are usually done between adjacent rows, but as the rows become separated it is easier to do all splits on one inbred, then the next, then the third, keeping each inbred as close together as possible but likely walking amoung inbreds.  Sort tags accordingly, putting each sequence in a separate, garishly labelled stack.  5.  Organize males by destination and type of pollination, with back-crosses the first priority always.  Check tag count and if needed prioritize males.',toni,date(13,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).


idea(48,'Pollinating tricks.  1.  Slip a shoot bag between males of different types of pollination or inbreds as a visual marker.  2.  Keep stacks of females in deep right apron pocket for safety until needed.  3.  Fold printout so it slips easily into the mouth of the outer-most tassel bag, male numbers on top so taht most of the page remains tucked inside.  Group pollinations so that each type is visible at once if possible.  4.  Keep palm clipped to apron in left shallow pocket; stapler and sharpie and next stacks in right deep pocket; back-up stapler in left outer pocket with rubber bands.  Paper clips in right front pocket with current mommies, pencil (clipped far to side) and spare stacks.  Shoot bags in center with knife in sheath and data-collecting shoot bags behind it, next to me.  Don''t have too many shoot bags.  Tassel bags in left deep pocket --- not too many or it is hard to get them out.  Box of staples, padded as clips are removed, in outer right pocket along with infirm paper clips.    5.  Set up extra bag first, but if a split, don''t staple the daddy tag on until the first pollination is done --- if there is not enough pollen for more than one, the other tags are more easily recovered.  Be sure to strain the bag slightly so it is likelier to stay open.  6.  Bend or straddle so that mouth of bag is clearly visible above ear --- do not pollinate blindly --- focus on the ear/bag zone.  Dumps and sprinkles are easier too.  7.  Gently bend back plant for easier access and to keep its tassel out of the way.   Teeth and body are valuable.   8.  Use third, fourth, and fifth fingers of right hand to help open extra bag to cover ear while the rest of the fingers hold the pollen bag if needed.  8.  When setting up, the only crease needed is the diagonal one, which should be tight.  Then paper clips are much less likely to be bent.  A light squeeze will tell if it needs to go to the infirmary after removal.  9.  Leave left hand on the bag at the mommy tag until all scanning is completed.  10.  If not enough pollen, dump it and save tags for resetting tassel that evening, putting these in the reset bag in front of the knife.',toni,date(13,8,2009),time(12,0,0)).

idea(51,'The optimum ear size seems to be a fat cigar --- in width (ca. 1 inch) and length (ca. 6).  For W23, look at the ear from its node; Mo20W and M14 pull away more from the stem and are easier to see.  As a rule, a shedding center spike is a good signal for our lines, though other lines will have shedding and silking out of synchrony (either can be advanced).

idea(58,'Mo20W needs heat to silk; the tassels are proud before the silks.  Has many husk leaves.  There were 1 -- 3 shoots/plant this year, but often the top ''shoot'' was vestigial and would not produce an ear.

idea(80,'Gerry says that Mo20W and W23 have their first ears around leaves 8 -- 9.  So this means the first planting is already too late to do anything but figure out how to dissect and photograph.

idea(87,'Turns out the best way to hold the leaf was double-sided carpet tape (cloth or fiberglass) to hold the leaf and pins to mark the V of the ligules.

idea(89,'Track the sacrificed plants carefully.  If nothing else, number all plants in the row with stakes when leaves are marked so that when the remaining plants are tagged there are no mix-ups.  Write the plant''s number on its stem as it is removed.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).


idea(90,'As the mutants are scored, remove a tag for those that will be crossed and place in the watch list.  As the plants are monitored, place tags in shoot bags, ordered by date the tassels should be set.  The tags can be moved among the dated shoot bags as development proceeds.  This is easier and more direct in the field than scoring tassels and producing printed lists.  Tassels that should be reset should have another tag pulled and inserted into the day''s shoot bag as the current set-up is collected.  There will still be tassel bags and scribbled plant numbers in the set-up list, but fewer.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).

idea(91,'The real point of cutting silks is to assess the vigor of the ear.  Old ears that don''t extend their silks much don''t make good kernels.  Uncut ears, if young, make great kernels --- but it can be hard to tell how vigorous the ear is.  This year I was able to cut mutant ears in the evening when setting up the bags for selfing the next morning, and inbred ears in the late afternoon.  I found I prefer a slightly shorter brush --- ca 1.5 cm --- as it has less chance of touching the leaf or culm.  Big cigar is still about right for all three inbreds.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).

idea(93,'Tag production worked great, but ordering needs a little work.  Separate the mutants and inbreds into different files.  Order inbreds by planting, then W, M, S --- should work for most years, sometimes S and M may flip.  Order mutants by planting, then hybrids, W, M, S.  Promote more rapidly developing mutants based on field observation. Print the row number so it is visible in rack in apron on first tag in row!  Figure out a jig to let one saw the tags apart. Tag mutants first and score while tagging!  Tag inbreds when shoot-bagging starts.  This lets one place the tags high on the inbreds (less stooping, easier to read) and in convenient places on the mutants.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).

idea(94,'Gerry''s pull-apart trick for desperate ears works.  Cut the silks and wait til the tips are brown.  Then when pollinating, pinch the husk leaves and pull apart to expose the silks below their tips.  Pollinate as usual.  Use only young ears for this and watch carefully for contamination.  Better to use for dominants than recessives as spotting problems is easier.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).

idea(95,'Glassine bags work too.  The tassel will be moist in the fresh-tassel way, but not wet from dew.  Fold the back of the bag over and crease it tightly so pollen doesn''t lodge in the flaps. Staple the daddy tag to the folded-over part.  Place the bag on the spike or branch, closing the bottom like a Kraft bag with a paper clip for an hour.  Pollen should be visible in the bag when collecting.  The glassine bag can be placed between a few Kraft bags in the apron, but don''t wait very long to pollinate --- at most a few bags can be done at once, especially since this technique is often used for splitting pollen.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).



idea(96,'The harvest procedure followed for 10r should be implemented in a crop_management predicate:  the peak of the pollinations is determined, and for each pollination, its offset relative to the peak calculated (positive if pollinated before the peak, 0 if during the peak, negative if after the peak).  Then for each row, the mean, min, and max offsets are calculated, and the rows sorted first by min offset, then by row number.  The aim is to produce a file like  ../../crops/10r/management/harvest3.  A table of threshold dates and a table of onion bag color-coding is also included.  This made harvest very easy and the color-coding simplifies sorting in the seed room.',date(17,9,2010),time(6,0,0)).
