Thanks everyone.
The actual invoice will not go out until July.  I’ll try to remember to copy Jason and Dan on that email….but no guarantees!

Thank you,
Sherry

hi Sherry,

[I felt I'd let Alain down by not going, but Bretagne in the early spring was just not enough of a lure for me either, despite the careful placement next to spring break.]

Anyway, here's our request.  I'm pretty sure I have the MoCode right.  Jason is now in charge of the money.

thanks all and cheers,

Toni

Hi Maize Geneticists,

I’m sure most of you are in France, enjoying the maize meetings.  But spring is here and it’s time to request land at Genetics Farm! 

Attached is the land request form and the Genetics Farm map (corn fields in yellow).  Please return the request form by April 10.

Thank you!
Sherry
