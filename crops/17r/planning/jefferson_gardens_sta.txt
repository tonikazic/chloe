Hi all,
 
Attached is the farm map with the FINAL field assignments.  
 
Regarding planting dates ---  
Now that we’ve gotten some rain and the temperatures are closer to normal, I’m not nearly as pessimistic about a hot dry year!  J  
 
Some people mentioned a potential planting date as early as April 24---that is next week already.  With the forecast for 1” of rain on Friday, that may not be possible.  Just watch the forecast and the weather station info at Jefferson Gardens next door: http://agebb.missouri.edu/weather/realtime/columbia.asp
 
If you want to revise your planting dates, please let me know ASAP so I can send this info on to Chris/Matt.
 
Happy planting!
Sherry
