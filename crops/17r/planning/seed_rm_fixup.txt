hi Sherry,

well, I don't know the cost of rekeying, but I might could scrounge up a little money for a couple of little drawers or one good-sized one.

We use the grocery carts because we can't find regular carts.  Would rather have regular carts and get rid of the grocery ones.

I think all boxes with my name on them have my stuff, but I'll double-check next time I'm there (soonish, like this weekend or next week).

Hooray for you in getting this done!

cheers,

Toni

Hi everyone,

Thanks to everyone for your time and input on cleaning out the Sears seed room.  I think we have a plan in place to clean off the shelves along the east wall (left hand side as you enter the room).  After this is accomplished, I think almost everyone will be able to have a shelf section along that wall—there are 11 sections of shelving and 12/13 labs that use the room.  I don’t necessarily need a shelf.

A series of questions/comments where I’d like your input.  Please reply to just me—not everyone—unless your response involves someone else:
1  Grocery Carts:  They take up a lot of space.  Who do these belong to?  Who uses them, for what (storage vs transport) and how often/how many at a time?  How many should we keep?  We will certainly keep some, but do we need 10?
2  Locks for the Drawers:  Toni pointed out that all those drawers under the tables have locks that we can re-key.  If you are interested in this as a way to secure your more valuable items, are you willing to commit $$ for a drawer or two?  (keep in mind that this reorg does not have any budget, so this is home-grown effort here)
3  Bamboo Stakes:   There is pile of bamboo stakes on the shelves.  If you need any for Sears, take some (but not all) soon.  The leftovers will be taken to the Genetics Farm since they were originally purchased with corn money (Georgia’s).
4  Cardboard Boxes, two kinds down there:  the waxed corn seed storage boxes will be kept, hopefully on top of the shelves as that space gets cleared off.  But there are lots of other misc. boxes, probably from seed shipments back from winter nurseries.  If you want to keep them, label them ASAP with bright tape/name and put them someplace else during the cleanup.  Otherwise they will be recycled.  I noticed some from McSteen and Kazic labs, but I’m sure there are others as well.

In addition to cleaning off the shelves, the other thing that will happen at the beginning is moving Jim’s DH pipe to the west wall.  Jim and Wayne/Rich, can we talk about moving the gas cylinders and attaching them to the west wall?  

Thanks!
Sherry

Hi all,

I’d like 10 minutes with each of you regarding the Sears Seed Processing Room. 

The room is a mess and it’s time to clean up and reorganize.  We have another table that we want to put in the room to provide more workspace, but this will require some reorganization.  The shelves are full of things that don’t appear to be used.  
I would like to do a 10 minute tour with each of you to talk about what’s yours, if you want to keep it/trash it/move it, and see if you have any suggestions to improve the room, given the limitations that we are under.   ((Jim, we’ve already met, so you’re excused.))

I am available most of today (Thursday) and Friday.  I am gone for spring break.  I am available most of the week of April 3. 
I’d like to do the reorganizing soon, so please let me know when you’re available ASAP – I really don’t need much of your time. 

Thanks,
Sherry
