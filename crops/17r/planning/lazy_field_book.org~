* general remarks


** background <2017-05-20 Sat> :toni:

The general plan is to have a small field since we have a lot to do, both
for work and fun in the field; a lot to do in the lab; and lots of
manuscripts and proposals to write.




** goals  <2017-05-21 Sun> :toni:


Goals are:

   + capture imagery for drone algorithm development
      + fly entire field and farms
      + asymmetric targets, placed asymmetrically on watering posts; these
        need to be durable for the whole season so they don't have to be
        put up and taken down each time
      + perpendicular and top-down for all fields; and oblique angles; and
        circling to keep landmarks in view for mosaicing
      + along and across rows
      + get ticket
      + train Kate and Avi

   + instrumentation development and experimentation

   + try to unstick stuck pedigrees with row shading: les15; cytogenetics?

   + push along branches that are close to finishing

   + doubled haploids from Candi
   + back-cross Balint-Kurti mutants

   + stay in the lab and process data!

   + PHOTOGRAPH BEFORE POLLINATIONS!

   + finish mutant data collection before pollinations

   + make a nice color bar for the field, and use that.

   + talk with a production agronomist in extension --- Ken Sudduth?; what
     should we measure that would help farmers with their decision-making?

** strategy and tables

In 17r, need to do serious bulking and push recessives along.  Relatively
few bcs in dominants, and those that are are mostly stalled or rebuilds.

** crop notes

#+begin_rmk had to avoid sw and se corners <2017-05-30 Tue>
We had 20 good rows running east-west, parallel to the long axis of the
field.  The southwest and southeast corners are quite wet and so were
avoided; row 1 (r00001) begins on the southwest side.  Skipped n rows in
the southwest corner (planted in sweet corn) and m rows in the southeast
corner (planted in Amish 1 roasting corn from 16r).
#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk sweet corn jammed in <2017-05-30 Tue>
Weather and soil perfect.  Not much room: had to jam a single border row on
the north and south sides into the track of the tractor tread, right next
to the grass.  These had 1--5 seeds/hole; began in northwest corner and
switched to multiple seeds/hole midway in the second range.  On the east
and west sides, we have about half a range of sweet corn, again right up to
the grass.

#+begin_rmk elite, sweet, and fun corn <2017-05-30 Tue>

Field at Bradford, 17' rows, 6 rows 30 cl each. Strong lesions, plant late.


I am pretty sure the big metabolic effect 9short, spindly) for W23 is with Les7, as we
planted out all the steps in 13r and sampled.  So use this demo to confirm
that.
