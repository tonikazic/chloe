The blog below is filled with nonsense responses, but comments by “Anonymous” are on target; anyone who listens quietly on a still, warm night or day in the peak elongating growth phase can hear pops or squeaks.   They occur naturally as the sheath is pushed through, telescope-like, most notably at night.  It can be simulated by pulling out a tassel or top with leaves.  
Now, (1) will conditions on August 21st will be suitably warm, sticky, and still? (2) will the plants still be in telescoping phase? (3) will the brief dark period have the “right” effect?   I’m more sure of squeaking corn than any of these conditions.
Genetically, I am not familiar with a mutant that would respond on that time scale — we have altered responses to gravity and light and touch but on a much longer time scale. 
As to drought stressed untwisting, or circadian responses, this is a question for a physiological specialist.

Hi all,
 
See message below about response of corn to solar eclipse.  Do any of you know of a mutant that may respond to the upcoming solar eclipse?  If so, please response to Tim directly:  ReinbottT@missouri.edu

Sherry and Susan,
Stephanie and I are working with Angela Speck and Bethany Stone to record how plants and animals  respond during the eclipse on August 21st.   We are wanting to show how plants such as mimosa close up in the evening and possibly show how a drought stressed plant would untwist during the eclipse.   We also will try to show the circadian rhythm in plants by showing that some plants will not respond to the reduced light (or darkness) in the middle of the day.     These videos can be used by K-12 and Mu students in class.  We even are thinking about live streaming from Bradford.
 
Are there any corn mutants that either would or would not show the response to light?    If so, it would be fun to show them also.
 
What do you think?
Thanks,
Tim
