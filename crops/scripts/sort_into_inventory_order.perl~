# this is /athe/c/maize/crops/sort_into_inventory_order.perl


# given a file, each line of which begins with a maternal numerical
# genotype, sort the lines into our usual inventory order:
#
#       crop, R > G > N
#       mutants > S > W > M > B > crop improvement > popcorn
#
# idea is to grab each line:
#
#       ($ma_num_gtype,$rest);
#
# insert into a hash for each crop with key $ma_rowplant and value
# $ma_num_gtype :: rest;
#
# sort the keys of each hash;
#
# output the hashes in an order given by a combination of @crop =
# ('R','G','N') and  @years, the latter obtained from the $ma_num_gtype as
# they're read;
#
# include appropriate separating comments of the form, %\n% crop\n%\n as we
# do now by hand.
#
# Is it ok to overwrite the input file?
