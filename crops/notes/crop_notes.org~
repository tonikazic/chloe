** first planting <2014-06-16 Mon> :toni:

First planting in between 1500 -- 2100.  Conditions perfect. 

Twinkle-taped all important corn, including Gerry's.  Fortunately we ran
out of sweet corn, as Gerry then used those rows later in the week.




#+begin_rmk <2014-06-20 Fri> 9:00 --- no pegging yet!  

Gerry agrees if no rain by
Monday, to ask Chris to water.  He says under these conditions the corn can
sit in dry soil for a day or two and then still germinate, but we are
running out of soil moisture.

#+begin_rmk <2014-06-22 Sun> 10:00 :toni:

Corn has coleoptile and first leaf out!  Not visible yesterday.

** second and third plantings <2014-06-21 Sat> and <2014-06-25 Wed> :toni:

#+begin_rmk  planting theory and reality <2014-06-25 Wed> :toni:

I was too distracted Saturday afternoon and so missed the brewing
thunderstorm.  I rushed out and planted row 122 and three others from the
second planting before the rain hit.  We ended up with about 2.25" of rain
over the week-end.  No sign of pegging.  This will be the nominal second
planting in crop.pl.


On Wednesday morning the field was fine to walk on and the forecast is 40%
chance of rain the next five days, so we went ahead and put in the
remainder of the second planting and all of the third today.  This will be
the nominal third planting in crop.pl.


This was done:  very soft crust, not too much mud.  Nonetheless, we checked
the planters for carry-over after each slightly damp row.  The Saturday
the corn is not yet pegged.  We aniticpate rain over the next few days so am
not yet worried about crust.


I also planted the demo corn . . . field 12 was much muddier and there was
a big rill right down my row 9.  So I swapped rows 9 and 10, preferring to
jeopardize the controls.


FINALLY, all the corn is in.  Now we must see how it does.

#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk second planting up on <2014-06-30 Mon> :toni:

Looks like (drive-by eyeballing) the real second planting, nominally the
third planting, is pegging as of 9ish this morning.  So proposed to :derek:
and :linh: that stand counts be postponed until this weekend, when more of
the corn is likely to be up.  Then, if it is counted two weekends hence,
that should take care of all stand counting, with two passes at each row.
Hoeing needs to be done with stand counting.

Demo corn also up, pegging, again based on drive-by.

Much twinkle tape down.  Asked :derek: to hammer it in, but think we will
have to sharpen our stakes for next year (saw!).


First planting continues to look good.  Weather warm and wet (very humid
this morning!).


With all this fortuitously timed rain, don't think we will need to bust
crust this year.

** fixes needed


*** missing row 122

**** first thoughts <2014-06-18 Wed> :toni:

Planted all first planting packets except for r00122, p00151.  We
substituted
12N3891:0005005 x 12N3891:0005005 (S/lls1 K10602, 2nd selfed) for the planned
12N305:W0039207 x 12N3614:0024110 (W23/Les8 K2405, 6th), but somehow the
packet didn't get planted. --- Luckily!


Repack the Les8, as we have plenty of kernels, and plant in second
planting.

The lls1 goes into row 61 in the second planting.



**** second thoughts, after thinking about the mis-relabelling <2014-06-21 Sat> :toni:

packed_packet(p00151,'12N3891:0005005','12N3891:0005005',30,avi,date(06,06,2014),time(15,08,18)).
planted(r00061,p00151,20,fake,date(16,6,2014),time(16,53,53),full,'14R').

Fortunately, the bogus packet is not yet planted.

However, something was.  The seed packet label says 12N3891:0005005 x 12N3891:0005005 
is p00111, for row 61.  The data say:

packed_packet(p00111,'12R305:W0000205','12R3577:0020708',15,toni,date(06,06,2014),time(16,21,41)).
planted(r00199,p00111,10,derek,date(16,06,2014),time(19,02,33),full,'14R').

Labels say that line is p00070 for row 121.


Hmmm, the packet numbers are off by the suspicious 40.  But row 122 falls
on p. 7, column 18.


What the dickens is going on?


**** seed room:  no packet found.  Still don't know what happended.


*** DONE mis-relabelling of mutant packets when replacing stickers for inbred packets <2014-06-21 Sat> :toni:



% puzzling!  back-tracking issues because we have the wrong datetime in the
% 14r packed_packet data??
%

%

% seed labels).
%

% is the packed packet number - 40!
% 
%
% When I recomputed the seed packet labels so that the inbreds would be

% more than the new numbers.
%
% However, the new seed packet labels also have row 123, p00010,
% 11N205:S0036710 x 11N3445:0015105, out of inventory order.  But contents
% the same in old and new labels.
%
% Remaining rows on the 2nd page of the new seed packet labels are:

%
% (right column) 158, 161, 196 (2nd), 96, 197, 275, 141, 48 (2nd), 49 (2nd), 152.
%
% Messed up rows are:
%
% 78, 157, 159, 156, 160, 158, 161, 96, 197, 275, 141, 152

%
% where x is in the middle column and y the right.  
%
%
%
% So he replaced the whole page except the top three in the middle column!
%
% Kazic, 20.6.2014

Avi confirms he replaced.  The six erroneous labels from the second
planting were peeled off.

*** DONE order and look at all physical packets <2014-06-23 Mon> :derek: and :linh:

They went through all the first planting packets and found the mutant ones
that had acquired an extra label.  The list tallies exactly with what I
expected from the previous section.


*** DONE fix planted.pl records for the mis-labelled first planting mutant packets*** TODO check that doubly labelled? p00011 in planted.pl against physical packet; and other fruity packets in planted.pl :toni:


** stand counts <2014-06-25 Wed> :toni:

Anticipate starting these middle of next week as we still have some
straggler plants coming up.  Two passes after that should do it.
