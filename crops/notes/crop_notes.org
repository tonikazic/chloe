** first planting <2014-06-16 Mon> :toni:

First planting in between 1500 -- 2100.  Conditions perfect. 

Twinkle-taped all important corn, including Gerry's.  Fortunately we ran
out of sweet corn, as Gerry then used those rows later in the week.




#+begin_rmk <2014-06-20 Fri> 9:00 --- no pegging yet!  

Gerry agrees if no rain by
Monday, to ask Chris to water.  He says under these conditions the corn can
sit in dry soil for a day or two and then still germinate, but we are
running out of soil moisture.

** second and third plantings <2014-06-21 Sat> and <2014-06-25 Wed> :toni:

#+begin_rmk  planting theory and reality <2014-06-25 Wed> :toni:

I was too distracted Saturday afternoon and so missed the brewing
thunderstorm.  I rushed out and planted row 122 and three others from the
second planting before the rain hit.  We ended up with about 2.25" of rain
over the week-end.  No sign of pegging.  This will be the nominal second
planting in crop.pl.


On Wednesday morning the field was fine to walk on and the forecast is 40%
chance of rain the next five days, so we went ahead and put in the
remainder of the second planting and all of the third today.  This will be
the nominal third planting in crop.pl.


This was done:  very soft crust, not too much mud.  Nonetheless, we checked
the planters for carry-over after each slightly damp row.  The Saturday
the corn is not yet pegged.  We aniticpate rain over the next few days so am
not yet worried about crust.


I also planted the demo corn . . . field 12 was much muddier and there was
a big rill right down my row 9.  So I swapped rows 9 and 10, preferring to
jeopardize the controls.


FINALLY, all the corn is in.  Now we must see how it does.

#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk second planting up on <2014-06-30 Mon> :toni:

Looks like (drive-by eyeballing) the real second planting, nominally the
third planting, is pegging as of 9ish this morning.  So proposed to :derek:
and :linh: that stand counts be postponed until this weekend, when more of
the corn is likely to be up.  Then, if it is counted two weekends hence,
that should take care of all stand counting, with two passes at each row.
Hoeing needs to be done with stand counting.

Demo corn also up, pegging, again based on drive-by.

Much twinkle tape down.  Asked :derek: to hammer it in, but think we will
have to sharpen our stakes for next year (saw!).


First planting continues to look good.  Weather warm and wet (very humid
this morning!).


With all this fortuitously timed rain, don't think we will need to bust
crust this year.

** fixes needed


*** missing row 122

**** first thoughts <2014-06-18 Wed> :toni:

Planted all first planting packets except for r00122, p00151.  We
substituted
12N3891:0005005 x 12N3891:0005005 (S/lls1 K10602, 2nd selfed) for the planned
12N305:W0039207 x 12N3614:0024110 (W23/Les8 K2405, 6th), but somehow the
packet didn't get planted. --- Luckily!


Repack the Les8, as we have plenty of kernels, and plant in second
planting.

The lls1 goes into row 61 in the second planting.



**** second thoughts, after thinking about the mis-relabelling <2014-06-21 Sat> :toni:

packed_packet(p00151,'12N3891:0005005','12N3891:0005005',30,avi,date(06,06,2014),time(15,08,18)).
planted(r00061,p00151,20,fake,date(16,6,2014),time(16,53,53),full,'14R').

Fortunately, the bogus packet is not yet planted.

However, something was.  The seed packet label says 12N3891:0005005 x 12N3891:0005005 
is p00111, for row 61.  The data say:

packed_packet(p00111,'12R305:W0000205','12R3577:0020708',15,toni,date(06,06,2014),time(16,21,41)).
planted(r00199,p00111,10,derek,date(16,06,2014),time(19,02,33),full,'14R').

Labels say that line is p00070 for row 121.


Hmmm, the packet numbers are off by the suspicious 40.  But row 122 falls
on p. 7, column 18.


What the dickens is going on?


**** seed room:  no packet found.  Still don't know what happended.

Anticipate starting these middle of next week as we still have some
straggler plants coming up.  Two passes after that should do it.




** general notes

#+begin_rmk bugs  <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

I asked :avi: and :linh: to check the crop every weekend, and they did, but
they missed a bad bug infestation.  Looks like caterpillars and Japanese
beetles.

It mainly hit the M14 and some of the B73.  Most of the mutants were
resistant.  Nonetheless, it was the worst we've ever had.  I've pointed
this out and told them to tell Matt and Chris when they start to see bugs.
But we should also walk through the field every few days.


#+end_rmk



#+begin_rmk  delays  <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

Our second/third planting, on the 25th, was 9 days after the first planting
on the 16th.  This is much too large a gap:  the W23s just starting coming
in on the <2014-08-18 Mon>, the M14s yesterday on the <2014-08-20 Wed>, and
the Mo20Ws probably won't come in until <2014-08-25 Mon> at the earliest.


So this is too late for many stragglers.  Mutants in the second planting
are more vigorous and came into the first planting pretty well.


So I think we need about a 5--6 day delay, rather than 7--9.

#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk not enough rows in the first planting <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

I scraped hard to have enough of everything except B73 (where I forgot to
cross in triplicate for a while).  

So next time, calculate the size of the first planting assuming everything
will land there, and reduce the sizes of the second and third planting of
just accommodate stragglers.  Need to analyze which plants crossed to first
planting inbreds when.

#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk what is it with M14, anyway?  <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

STILL not enough M14 . . . germination rate quite poor.  Just figure on
doubling the number of estimated rows.




#+end_rmk


*** TODO run germination test on M14 :toni:


#+begin_rmk grouping the inbreds together really helps <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

The plants seem to like it much better and it simplifies shootbagging and
watching for ears.

#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk weather <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

Only now are we having properly hot Missouri weather.  Most of the season
it has been cool.  We also didn't need much irrigation.


The cool weather, combined with our late planting (around the solstice!),
seemed to have a big effect on our phenotypes.  Notes by mutant follow, but
we seemed to have an unusual amount of sterile or rudimentary tassel in our
lines.  Mo20W mutants sometimes showed only center spike, or center spike
and a few small branches.


Another effect of the cool weather was that the tassels exhausted unusually
fast . . . they steadily dribbled pollen (I could have pollinated in the
evening, it felt like Hawai'i), so they emptied of pollen very quickly.  It
felt as though we had 3--5 days/tassel on average, with some perhaps having
2.5 days.




#+end_rmk

#+begin_rmk bulking <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

I did much better at bulking this year, catching the tassels early.
Nonetheless, in a number of lines the mutant tassels and wild-type ears are
out of sync, sometimes by a lot.


Several mutants had poor germination rates, producing only a few plants.

#+end_rmk


 
*** TODO for very asynchronous lines, plant a second planting to provide wild-type ears for slow males :toni:
and vice versa.


*** TODO check germination rates for mutants and wild types for each line :toni: and :wade:



#+begin_rmk lingering mysteries <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

The biggest one is a block of nominally Les2 rows that had very tall,
vigorous corn with no phenotype.  I think this points to an error in
pedigrees or family numbers.

#+end_rmk


*** TODO sort out descent of rows with no phenotype :toni:


#+begin_rmk shading sickly mutants <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

I had planned to lightly shade the llses with shade cloth, thinking this
would help tassel formation and overall plant health.  We didn't:  instead,
I cut out very little around the mutants.  Eventually I was worried enough
about tassel development that I did open up some space around selected
mutants.  But I don't think it mattered:  mutants with good exposure were
still quite sick and unmanly if they wanted to be.


#+end_rmk


#+begin_rmk field size <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

This was great!  I could score in a day, walk through the whole field in a
day, and easily keep track.  Even smaller would be better.

The amount of bulking meant there was a LOT of shoot-bagging, so I refined
my technique.

#+end_rmk


*** TODO make movies of shoot-bagging, tassel-bagging, and tagging.



#+begin_rmk tag trauma again <2014-08-21 Thu> :toni:

Our nifty threefer tags on 110# paper tended to tear at the top of the
third tag when the paper got wet --- especially if windy.  :avi: and :linh:
had to go over the field and restaple them.  I also found many tags with
that join partially torn.


We think the explanation is that the heavier paper absorbs more rainwater,
making that perforation more fragile.  I missed this in the garden trials
as I stapled the tags hanging vertically, and they were pretty sheltered.


:avi: noticed that if the tag is further down the plant, it was less likely
to be torn by the wind.

Ideas:

+ no more threefers

+ lighter paper, or more water-proof paper

+ different stapling technique


I am very reluctant to give up my third tear-off.


I tried a different stapling method in the second/third planting inbreds:
overlap the third perforation with the tag by about a quarter inch; staple
as usual; and staple the top of the third tag to the overlap.  We'll see
how that does at the end of the year.




#+end_rmk


*** TODO better tag trials :toni:

+ horizontal placement, like on plant

+ put in front yard to catch NW wind (or out at the farm to annoy the
  neighbors less --- tell Matt and Chris)

+ try different overlapping and stapling methods:
    + current two-staple with quarter inch overlap
    + one center staple with quarter inch overlap
    + controls

+ overload tags with etra weight (more tags) and test fragility.




*** TODO shift fourth tear-off down so that there is more space        :toni:
between it and the tiniest barcode.

*** planting error?

Possibly . . . avi planted all these, rows 41--43 in the second planting
and the rest in the first planting.  Seems unlikely, but :aditya: was
scanning.


*** embryonic lethal?

Possibly for rows 41--43.  Hard to see that for row 40, since there are no
plants.

Check seed in seed room this fall after harvest.


Doesn't explain row 140.


*** mice?

Again, this explains row 40 but not the others.


*** ipad collision on scanning during packing?

Possibly: we thought we caught all of these but maybe we didn't.

Buy an extra ipad.
